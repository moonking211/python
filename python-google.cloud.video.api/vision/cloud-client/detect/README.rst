Google Cloud Vision API Python Samples
===============================================================================

This directory contains samples for Google Cloud Vision API. `Google Cloud Vision API`_ allows developers to easily integrate vision detection features within applications, including image labeling, face and landmark detection, optical character recognition (OCR), and tagging of explicit content.

- See the `migration guide`_ for information about migrating to Python client library v0.25.1.

Setup
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Authentication
++++++++++++++

This sample requires you to have authentication setup. Refer to the
`Authentication Getting Started Guide`_ for instructions on setting up
credentials for applications.

Detect
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++



To run this sample:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python detect.py

    usage: detect.py [-h]
                     {faces,faces-uri,labels,labels-uri,landmarks,landmarks-uri,text,text-uri,logos,logos-uri,safe-search,safe-search-uri,properties,properties-uri,web,web-uri,crophints,crophints-uri,document,document-uri}
                     ...
    
    This application demonstrates how to perform basic operations with the
    Google Cloud Vision API.
