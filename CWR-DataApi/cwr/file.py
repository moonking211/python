"""
CWR file structure and information model.

These classes represent a CWR file. This consists on two parts: the metadata
on the filename and data inside the file.

The file data is stored into groups, which then are stored into a single
transmission. Both of these structures contain a header and a trailer record,
which serve not only to mark the beginning and end of them, but also, in the
case of the trailer records, to validate the previous rows.

Being these four header and trailer records, called control records, are
Transmission Header (HDR), Transmission Trailer (TRL), Group Header (GRH) and
Group Trailer (GRT).

These are grouped into a single transmission composed by several groups: [HDR,
[GRH,GRT]*, TRL].

Additionally to the internal data structure this module allows to represent
the file's metadata, stored according to the standard in the file name, with
FileTag, which stores the information used to identify and differentiate CWR
files.
