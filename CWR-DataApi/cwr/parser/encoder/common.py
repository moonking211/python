"""
Base classes for implementing encoder parsers.

An encoder parser receives an instance of a model class and returns a data
structure.

For example, it may receive a CWRFile instance and return a JSON.

All encoders are expected to implement the Encoder interface. This offers a
single method which receives the class to encode, and returns an equivalent
data structure.
