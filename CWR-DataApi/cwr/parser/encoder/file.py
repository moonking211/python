"""
Parsers for encoding CWR model classes, creating a text string for them which
complies with the CWR standard.

While the encoder classes are accessible, they are meant to be used directly
only when creating custom versions, by default the factory methods
old_filename_encoder() and default_filename_encoder() should be used to
acquire the encoders to use when creating a file.

The old_filename_encoder() method will return an encoder which creates a
filename following the old specification, where ne numeric sequence consists
of two numbers, while the default_filename_encoder() will create a filename
following the new specification, where the sequence consists of four numbers.

Both encoders require a FileTag containing valid values, which will be
transformed into the resulting string.

These encoders are created from BaseCWRFileNameEncoder, just setting the
correct sequence number length.
