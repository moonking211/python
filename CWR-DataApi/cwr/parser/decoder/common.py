"""
Base classes for implementing decoder parsers.

A decoder parser receives a data structure and returns an instance of a class
from the domain model.

For example, it may receive a JSON and return a CWRFile instance.

All decoders are expected to implement the Decoder interface. This offers a
single method which receives the data to decode, and returns an equivalent
model class instance.

Additionally, a decoder for handling grammar rules is included:
- GrammarDecoder, which decodes a string applying a Pyparsing grammar rule.

Note that in the context of the project these parsers are expected to be
lossfull. Not all the data in the CWR files is useful, some rows contains
information which can be safely ignored, but also they may parse sources, such
as JSON structures, where additional and unneeded data has been added.
