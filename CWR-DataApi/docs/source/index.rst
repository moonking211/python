The CWR API library offers a model to represent the content of files following
the CISAC CWR standard.

With this model, and various helper classes, it is not only possible to read
and show those files, but also to operate
with the data they contain.

This library has been developed based on CWR specification version 2.1 revision
3, from December 10th 2004.
