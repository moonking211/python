IPI Number
==========

There are two fields which appear commonly in records refering to interested
parties: IPI Name Number and IPI Base Number. These are references to ISAC's
Interested Parties Information system, used by CISAC identify Interested
Parties on collective rights management data, and are stored on their
databases.

Sometimes this is refered as IPI/CAE number. But the CAE (Composer, Author and
Publisher, the E standing for 'Editeur') system is obsolete since 2001.

These codes are used along ISWC (International Standard Musical Work Code)
codes.
