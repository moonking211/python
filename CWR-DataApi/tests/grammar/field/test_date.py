"""
Tests for Date (D) fields.

The following cases are tested (most tests are done for default and compulsory fields):

- Default name is set correctly
- Given name is set correctly
- Creating a new field does not change the existing ones names

- Accepts a year ending in several zeros
- Accepts a year ending in a single zero
- Accepts a valid date
- Accepts a date composed of zeros (empty date) (if not compulsory)
- Accepts a year beginning with zeros
- Accepts the smallest possible date

- An exception is thrown when the day is too high
- An exception is thrown when the day is too low
- An exception is thrown when the month is too high
- An exception is thrown when the month is too low
- An exception is thrown when the date begins with empty spaces
- An exception is thrown when the date contains letters
- An exception is thrown when the date is the empty string
- An exception is thrown when the date is composed of zeros (empty date) (if compulsory)
