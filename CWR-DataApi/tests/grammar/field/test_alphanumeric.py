"""
Tests for Alphanumeric (A) fields.

The following cases are tested (all tests are done for default and compulsory fields):

- Default name is set correctly
- Given name is set correctly
- Creating a new field does not change the existing ones names

- Accepts values with the correct number of characters
- Cuts strings which are longer than the required size
- Accepts values composed only of numbers
- Accepts values composed only of letters
- Accepts values trailed by whitespaces
- Accepts values headed by whitespaces.
- Accepts values surrounded by whitespaces
- Accepts values divided by whitespaces

- Accepts a string composed of whitespaces if it is not compulsory

- Accepts a string with non ASCII characters if it is extended

- Accepts a huge field with whitespaces
- Accepts a huge field with no whitespaces

- Accepts an empty string when the size is zero

- An exception is thrown when the columns are set as negative

- An exception is thrown when the field is empty and it shouldn't be
- An exception is thrown when the field is smaller than expected
- An exception is thrown when the field contains lowercase letters
- An exception is thrown when the field is not using capitol letters
- An exception is thrown when the field contains not ASCII characters
